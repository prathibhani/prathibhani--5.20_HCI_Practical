ðŸ“± Mobile App UI Prototype (Axure RP)
# This image shows a mobile app user interface prototype designed using Axure RP 9 Team Edition. The layout includes:

## A scenic mountain-themed image background.

- A bottom navigation bar with icon-based actions (Share, Like, Info, Delete).

- A right panel section for sharing options, information content, and action buttons ("Delete" and "Cancel").

- Interactive elements such as dynamic panels and buttons, allowing simulated user interactions like tap, swipe, and state changes.

This prototype was created for demonstrating UI/UX flows and interactive behavior during the design phase.
